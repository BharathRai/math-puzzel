# Math Adaptive Prototype

This project is a prototype for an adaptive math learning system. It generates puzzles, tracks user progress, and adapts the difficulty based on performance.

## Structure

- `src/main.py`: Entry point of the application.
- `src/puzzle_generator.py`: Generates math puzzles.
- `src/tracker.py`: Tracks user performance.
- `src/adaptive_engine.py`: Adjusts difficulty based on user stats.

## Usage

1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
